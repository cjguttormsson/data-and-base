# Data and Base: A Flesh and Blood db project

This project seeks to define an SQL schema defining the structure of cards in the game Flesh and Blood, and to provide a script that can be used to create and fill a complete database. 

## Why?

Defining a relational database for cards makes it possible to perform queries using the full expressiveness of SQL. It also enables the use database extensions, which can add powerful functionality like full text search.
